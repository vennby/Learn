# Learn
Learn is a passion project that aims to transform education. I envision it as a non-difficult to use, non-abstract, and interesting study tool that harnesses the
capabilities of AI, ML, LLM's, and abductive learning, just to name a few for now.

### :warning: Important Disclaimer: This Is A Prototype
For starters, here's what [Learn](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OEsS65VWoEB-v2zBf3DQT6_X9iKr2xXG/view?usp=sharing) could look like!

The source code in this repository was used to build a prototype of what Learn could look like, in its starting phase. It does not have an ML model powering it (yet).
This is the prototype that I used to explain my idea while I pitched it at ThinkAI'23 in BPDC.
